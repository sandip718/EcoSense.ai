# Requirements Document

## Introduction

EcoSense.ai is an environmental intelligence platform designed to help communities monitor local pollution levels in real-time across air, water, and noise metrics. The platform combines open environmental data with user-submitted media analysis to provide actionable insights through an intuitive dashboard. Users can access real-time pollution data, upload environmental photos for AI analysis, receive trend insights, and get personalized recommendations for community-level environmental actions.

3. WHEN processing environmental images THEN the AI SHALL analyze visual pollution indicators such as water turbidity, air smog density, and visible contamination
4. WHEN image analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL return confidence scores and specific pollution indicators detected
5. WHEN image analysis fails THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages and fallback options

### Requirement 3: Environmental Trend Analysis and Insights

**User Story:** As a community member, I want to understand environmental trends over time, so that I can make informed decisions about outdoor activities and advocate for environmental improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing environmental data THEN the system SHALL identify trends over daily, weekly, and monthly periods
2. WHEN pollution levels change significantly THEN the system SHALL generate alerts with severity levels
3. WHEN generating insights THEN the system SHALL correlate multiple data sources (API data, image analysis, historical patterns)
4. WHEN trends indicate health risks THEN the system SHALL provide specific health impact assessments
5. WHEN environmental improvements are detected THEN the system SHALL highlight positive changes and potential causes

### Requirement 4: Community Action Recommendations

**User Story:** As a community member, I want to receive practical recommendations for environmental action, so that I can contribute to improving local environmental conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pollution levels exceed safe thresholds THEN the system SHALL recommend immediate protective actions
2. WHEN analyzing community environmental data THEN the system SHALL suggest location-specific remediation strategies
3. WHEN generating recommendations THEN the system SHALL prioritize actions based on impact potential and feasibility
4. WHEN users request action guidance THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step implementation instructions
5. WHEN community actions are implemented THEN the system SHALL track and measure environmental impact over time

### Requirement 5: Interactive Dashboard and Visualization

**User Story:** As a community member, I want to view environmental data through an intuitive dashboard, so that I can quickly understand current conditions and trends in my area.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display real-time pollution heatmaps for air, water, and noise
2. WHEN displaying environmental data THEN the system SHALL provide interactive charts showing historical trends
3. WHEN users interact with visualizations THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by date range, pollution type, and geographic area
4. WHEN presenting data THEN the system SHALL use color-coded indicators for pollution severity levels
5. WHEN users need detailed information THEN the system SHALL provide drill-down capabilities for specific data points

### Requirement 6: Conversational AI Interface

**User Story:** As a community member, I want to ask natural language questions about environmental conditions, so that I can get personalized advice without navigating complex interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users ask environmental questions THEN the chatbot SHALL provide location-specific answers based on current data
2. WHEN users inquire about safety for activities THEN the system SHALL consider current pollution levels and health recommendations
3. WHEN users ask about trends THEN the chatbot SHALL reference historical data and provide context
4. WHEN users request recommendations THEN the chatbot SHALL suggest personalized actions based on their location and concerns
5. WHEN users ask comparative questions THEN the chatbot SHALL provide context like "air quality is 20% worse than last week"
6. WHEN the chatbot cannot answer a question THEN it SHALL gracefully redirect users to relevant dashboard sections or human support

### Requirement 7: Automated Workflow Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automated workflows to handle data processing and user interactions, so that the platform operates reliably without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the hourly data ingestion workflow runs THEN it SHALL fetch, validate, and store environmental data from all configured sources
2. WHEN users upload images THEN the image processing workflow SHALL automatically trigger AI analysis and store results
3. WHEN workflows encounter errors THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information and attempt recovery procedures
4. WHEN workflows complete successfully THEN the system SHALL update relevant dashboards and trigger any dependent processes
5. WHEN system load is high THEN workflows SHALL implement queuing and rate limiting to maintain performance

### Requirement 8: Data Quality and Reliability

**User Story:** As a community member, I want to trust the environmental data and insights provided, so that I can make confident decisions about my health and activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ingesting external data THEN the system SHALL validate data quality and flag anomalies
2. WHEN multiple data sources conflict THEN the system SHALL apply weighted averaging based on source reliability
3. WHEN data is missing or stale THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate data limitations to users
4. WHEN providing AI-generated insights THEN the system SHALL include confidence levels and data source attribution
5. WHEN users report data inaccuracies THEN the system SHALL provide feedback mechanisms and data correction workflows

### Requirement 9: Community Engagement and Gamification

**User Story:** As a community member, I want to be motivated to contribute environmental data and take action, so that I can be part of a larger environmental improvement effort.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users contribute environmental photos THEN the system SHALL award points and track contribution streaks
2. WHEN users complete recommended actions THEN the system SHALL allow them to report back and earn recognition
3. WHEN displaying community data THEN the system SHALL show aggregate impact metrics and community leaderboards
